## GURPS
[GURPS][gurps] stands for

> General Universal Role Playing System.

I started playing in college and that group of friends still get together regularly to play a games.

A lot of us have kids of their own, and we are starting to introduce them to GURPS as well.

I will therefore choose to generate GURPS adventures.
